# lyric.analysis
An R package that addresses lyric text data collection (by webscraping from www.songlyrics.com), lyric data formatting and cleaning, and lyric data exploration/visualization

This package is called lyric.analysis. The package addresses three major challenges: lyric text data collection, lyric data formatting and cleaning, and lyric data exploration and visualization. For users who want to do text data analytics on song lyrics of a certain song or artist they can use our package to web scrape the lyrics from a website called www.songlyrics.com. This website has a very large amount of lyric data from a wide variety of artists and genres. So, lyrics from any artist or song that is available on www.songlyrics.com can be webscrapped using our package. 
  Lyric.analysis also includes functions that will clean the text data once it is collected by removing punctuation, expanding contractions, or removing digits from the lyrics. The package also has a function that will format the raw html from the website into a more organized and useful format. 
  To help users visualize the web scrapped song lyrics, the package contains functions that will create document term matrices and word clouds from text data that has been formatted and cleaned. There is also a function that returns the proportion of certain sentiments in a vector of lyrics to help users explore the data further.
